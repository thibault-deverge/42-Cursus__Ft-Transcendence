## ft_transcendence : A Real-Time Multiplayer Pong Web Applicationk

## Overview
ft_transcendence is my final project at School 42. Itâ€™s a web-based multiplayer Pong game that brings together real-time gameplay, tournament systems, and live chat, all in a sleek Single-Page Application (SPA) format. Built with Django and Django REST on the backend and vanilla JavaScript/HTML/SCSS on the frontend, this project demonstrates full-stack capabilities, web security, and interactive gameplay design.
